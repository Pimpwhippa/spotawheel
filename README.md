For Task 1, the submission jupyter notebook file is spw2.ipynb. It has cleaned data, visualization, data preparation, model and evaluation, together with the description in the comments.
In file spw1 and spw3 there are the previous and following steps respectively.

For Task 2, the webapp is in the file stapp.py. You can just run it with streamlit run stapp.py. User can input their car details and will get a price prediction.
At the moment It's not deployed yet, but I will do it later tonight. For the design it will be updated in inproduction.docx

Ofcourse this is just the first version and still need some fine-tuning. But it works!

Task 1. Predict Cars

The data file contains sample data from cars. Your target for this task is to predict the
price. The end deliverable should be a jupyter notebook. 

    • Clean, describe and visualize the data 
    • Prepare the data for modelling (train/test, encoders etc)
    • Model and evaluate, show metrics and graphs. 
    • Describe your approach at each step.


Task 2. Deployment

    A. Create a simple custom web app for your model using Streamlit or any other library. Show the results of your model, metrics and graphs.

    B. Please propose and design a system and its components to deploy this model in production. With schematic representation and written description.
